I'm a Robotics Engineer in training, passionate about robot hardware and software design. I've worked on a wide range of robots and embedded systems projects, ranging from Atomic Clocks sent to the Stratosphere, [Autonomy systems for Factory Robots](https://github.com/Soldann/MORB_SLAM), [Robots in High Precision Physics](/projects/MAGGIE), [Continuum Robots](/projects/Continuum_Robot_Joining), Rover Platforms, [Autonomous Drones](/projects/Autonomous_Drone) and now Quadruped robots.

At the University of Toronto, I was the Science Lead at [Robotics For Space Exploration](https://rsx.skule.ca) where I lead the effort to design a series of science expirements to detect for signs of life, an [Autonomous Sample Retrieval System](/projects/RSX_Sample_Retrieval) and a system to autonomously perform our experiments. Experiments involved [FAD Fluorescence](/projects/FAD_Fluorescence), Amino Acid and Organic Compound tests, Terrain Mapping, Panorama Stitching and soil quality testing.

In my free time, I tend to work on smaller side projects that envolve both designing hardware and software. Examples include:
- Designing a fully 3D printable scaled down race car suspension (based on the Mercedes AMG One)
- Developing simplified [Robotics](https://github.com/Ryan-Red/Robot-Simulator) and [Physics](https://github.com/vuthalab/biot-savart) Simulators.
- Recreating Computer Vision tools like a [Panorama Stitcher](/projects/Panorama_Stitcher) (while minimizing use of libraries)

Outside of robotics, I tinker around the house, fly my drones and am passionate about design and understanding the inner workings of the things I use regularly.

See the [Projects](/projects/) page for information about some of my past and current projects!
