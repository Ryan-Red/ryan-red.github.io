I'm a Robotics Engineer in training, passionate about robot hardware and software design. I've worked on a wide range of robots and embedded systems projects, ranging from Atomic Clocks sent to the Stratosphere, [Autonomy systems for Factory Robots](/projects/MORBSLAM), [Robots in High Precision Physics](/projects/MAGGIE), [Continuum Robots](/projects/Continuum_Robot_Joining), Rover Platforms, [Autonomous Drones](/projects/Autonomous_Drone) and now Quadruped robots.

In my free time, I tend to work on smaller side projects that envolve both designing hardware and software. Examples include:
- Designing a fully 3D printable scaled down race car suspension (based on the Mercedes AMG One)
- Developing simplified [Robotics](/projects/Robot_Simulator) and [Physics](/projects/biot-savart) Simulators.
- Recreating Computer Vision tools like a [Panorama Stitcher](/projects/Panorama_Stitcher) (while minimizing use of libraries)

Outside of robotics, I tinker around the house, flying my drones and am passionate about design and understanding the inner workings of the things I use regularly.

See the [Projects](/projects/) page for information about some of my past and current projects!
