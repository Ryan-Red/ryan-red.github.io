I'm a Robotics Engineer in training, passionate about robot hardware and software design. I've worked on a wide range of robots and embedded systems projects, ranging from Atomic Clocks sent to the Stratosphere, Autonomous Factory Robots, Robots in High Precision Physics, [Continuum Robots](/_projects/Continuum_Robot_Joining.md), Rover Platforms and now Quadruped robots.

Outside of robotics, I tinker around the house, flying my drones and am passionate about design and understanding the inner workings of the things I use regularly.
