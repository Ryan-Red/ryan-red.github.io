I'm a Robotics Engineer in training, passionate about robot hardware and software design. I've worked on a wide range of robots and embedded systems projects, ranging from Atomic Clocks sent to the Stratosphere,Autonomous Factory Robots, [Robots in High Precision Physics](/projects/MAGGIE.md), [Continuum Robots](/projects/Continuum_Robot_Joining.md), Rover Platforms and now Quadruped robots.

In my free time, I tend to work on smaller side projects that envolve both designing hardware and software. Examples include designing a fully 3D printable scaled down race car suspension (based on the Mercedes AMG One), simplified Simulators from scratch ([Robotics](/projects/2D_Robot_Simulator.md) and Physics Based ones).

Outside of robotics, I tinker around the house, flying my drones and am passionate about design and understanding the inner workings of the things I use regularly.

See the [Projects](/projects/) page for information about some of my past and current projects!
