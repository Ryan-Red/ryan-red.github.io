This project was done as the lead of the Robotics for Space Exploration's (RSX) Science sub-team. The goal is to make a system to autonomously excavate and contain soil samples for further analysis, and then analyze the soil for signs of life present in the environment. This was done as a part of the CIRC 2023 Competition in Drumheller, AB, Canada.

The Team comprised of myself and 6 other junior members and involved collaborating with the all the other sub teams at RSX. Beyond this module, the Science subteam designs scientific experiments to test for traces of signs of life, designs the mechanical and electrical systems used and implements the software required to autonomously complete the tasks.
